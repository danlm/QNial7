# The purpose of this program is to test that
all the operations of Nial do not fail when
applied to a variety of data sets. It is expected
to run until completion logging places where it
produced a result that forced a jump to top
level. These test do not check for semantic correctness
of the operations, but just that they are robust when
given any kind of argument.

#  The data sets should be tailored to avoid problems that interrupt the execution.

# The datagen.ndf file contains generators for data in a number
of classes and lists of the names suitable for testing
unary, and binary soperations.

# The names of all the operations of Q'Nial are stored in the file: "allops".
The files "uniops" and "binops" contain the names of the data operations.
The coverage tests should run on these latter ones with no difficulty.

# The file "pictops" contains operations that are part of the
i/o capabilities of Q'Nial. 
The remaining operations in "otherops" are either
duplicate names or operations which have side-effects and cannot be
run from the coverage tests. Thus allops is retained just to ensure that
all operations have been considered.

# The three expressions Startunary, Startbinary, snd Startpict
initiate the test run for each of the above lists of operations.

# Space usage can be monitored when the tests are run with the
DEBUG version of Q'Nial. The space available message at the top
level should not change from its value after the point that 
"coverops.ndf" has been loadded.

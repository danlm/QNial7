# Identity Testing Program.

# This program drives the testing of the identity given as an
  argument string. It is expected to be run by loading
  a file like "idtests.ndf" that gives a call to the operation
  "idtest" with arguments the description of the id and the list of
  names of data sets to which it is to be applied.

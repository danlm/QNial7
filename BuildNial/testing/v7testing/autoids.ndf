# Identity Testing Program.


# This program drives the testing of the identity given as an
# argument string. It is expected to be run by loading
# a file like "idtests.ndf" that gives a call to the operation
# "idtest" with arguments the description of the id and the list of
# names of data sets to which it is to be applied.

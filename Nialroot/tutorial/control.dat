The Control examples describe ways of changing the sequence in which
expressions are executed. Normally, Q'Nial executes one expression after
another until it comes to the end of the expression sequence. Expressions that
change the order of execution are: if, case, for, while, repeat, exit.

The "IF" construct is used to decide between choices based on the value
of a comparison. The form is as follows:

   IF     <expr> THEN <expr sequence>
   ELSEIF <expr> THEN <expr sequence>
   ELSEIF <expr> THEN <expr sequence>
     ...
   ELSE               <expr sequence>
   ENDIF

.b Age := 17;
   IF Age >= 18 THEN "Army
   ELSEIF Age < 16 THEN "Minor
   ELSE "Juvenile
.e ENDIF
.p
The CASE construct has the following form:

   CASE   <expr> FROM
     L0:  <expr sequence> END
     L1:  <expr sequence> END
     L2:  <expr sequence> END
     ELSE <expr sequence>
   ENDCASE

.n Month := 3;

.b CASE Month FROM
      1: Month_name := "January; END
      2: Month_name := "February;END
      3: Month_name := "March;   END
   ELSE  Month_name := phrase 'April through December';
   ENDCASE;
.e Month_name

In this case, the CASE statement labels are 1,2,3. They could equally
well be "Jan "Feb "Mar.
.p
The "WHILE" construct is used to execute an expression sequence repeatedly
as long as the result of a comparison remains true.

   WHILE  <expr>  DO   <expr sequence>   ENDWHILE

.b whileexample IS OPERATION Win {
      Sequence := Null;
      WHILE last Sequence ~= Win DO
         D1 D2 := each ceiling (6 * random 2);
         Toss := sum D1 D2;
         Sequence := Sequence append Toss;
      ENDWHILE;
.e    Sequence }

.n whileexample 11

The parameter for whileexample is "Win". "Sequence is created as
an empty list. The WHILE loop continues as long as the last value
of the list is not equal to the value of "Win". At the end, the
value of "Sequence" is displayed.
.p
The "REPEAT" construct is used to execute an expression sequence repeatedly
until the result of a comparison is true.

   REPEAT   <expr sequence>   UNTIL <expr>   ENDREPEAT

.b repeatexample IS OPERATION Win {
      Sequence := Null ;
      REPEAT
        Sequence := Sequence append sum (EACH ceiling (6 * random 2))
      UNTIL last Sequence = Win
      ENDREPEAT ;
.e    Sequence }

.n repeatexample 3

The parameter for repeatexample is "Win". "Sequence is created as an empty
list. The body of the loop is executed at least once. The REPEAT loop
continues until the last value of the list is equal to the value of "Win".
At the end, the value of "Sequence" is displayed.
.p
The "FOR" construct is used to execute an expression sequence repeatedly
while a variable takes on successive values of the items of an expression.

   FOR  <variable>  WITH  <expr>  DO  <expr sequence>  ENDFOR

.s Mode := setformat 1 0 1;
.b Numbers := 2. 3. 5. 7. 11.;
   FOR X WITH Numbers DO
      write (X) (X*X) (X power X)
.e ENDFOR

X takes on values in Numbers in successive executions of the body of the
loop. The values of X, X squared and X to the power X are displayed.
.s set Mode; set "sketch;
.p
Result of a Loop expression

A loop expression is often used to repeat a sequence a certain number of
times and return a result. It is also used to repeat some side-effect of
the repeated sequence. A side-effect might be the writing of a record to a
file, for example.

If the intention is to return a value, the loop expression can be part of
an assignment expression.

.b List1 := 1 1 ;
   Fibonacci := FOR I WITH count 10 DO
      List1 := List1 append (sum (last List1) (second reverse List1))
   ENDFOR ;
.e write "Fib Fibonacci ;

.p
The EXIT expression can be used to exit from a repeat, while or for loop.

If an EXIT expression is evaluated, the loop terminates early and returns
with the value of the simple expression following the reserved word EXIT.

.b List1 := 1 1 ;
   Fibonacci := FOR I WITH count 10 DO
      IF last List1 > 10 THEN EXIT List1 ; ENDIF ;
      List1 := List1 append (sum (last List1) (second reverse List1))
   ENDFOR ;
.e write "Fib Fibonacci ;
.p
